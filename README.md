# ðŸ“¡ Network Engineering Projects ðŸš€  

This repository showcases my hands-on **network engineering, security, and automation** projects. It includes **Packet Tracer labs, troubleshooting documentation, network configurations, and Python scripts for automation**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure  
- **Troubleshooting-Labs/** â†’ OSPF, VLAN, and general networking troubleshooting labs.  
- **Network-Configurations/** â†’ VLAN setups, routing configs, and firewall rules.  
- **Security-Labs/** â†’ Hack The Box write-ups and security configurations.  
- **Automation-Scripts/** â†’ Python scripts for network automation.  

## ðŸ”¥ Skills Demonstrated  
- **Networking:** OSPF, VLANs, troubleshooting, and configurations.  
- **Security:** Firewall rules, Hack The Box labs, and hardening techniques.  
- **Automation:** Python scripting for networking (Netmiko, Paramiko).  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use  
1. Open the relevant folder for networking topics.  
2. Download **Packet Tracer/GNS3 files** to run the labs.  
3. Check out **Python scripts** for automation examples.  

## ðŸ“ˆ My Learning Focus  
âœ… **Deepening my networking knowledge (OSPF, BGP, VLANs, troubleshooting).**  
âœ… **Improving network automation using Python.**  
âœ… **Exploring security concepts through real-world labs.**
